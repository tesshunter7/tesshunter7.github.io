<h1> Aspects of AI</h1>
	<h2> Self-driving</h2>
<body background="blackhole.jpg" text="#FFFFFF">
<p> A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car (robo-car), is a car that is capable of traveling without human input. Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[6] Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles.
Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields.

Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels, according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016). The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.

As of December 2022, vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell a legally approved Level 3 car. Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021. In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car. In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.</p>
	<h2> AI Entertainment</h2>
	<p> Although there has not been much entertainment generated by AI because of the limitations of its own imagination, there may possibly be AI generated movies or books in the future. An expansion into the Library of Babel, a randomly generated library of letters and punctuation, could be possible in the near future.</p>
	<h2> Space Exploration</h2>
	<p> AI has not been used in space exploration yet, but it is possible in the near future that they can replace human jobs and help prepare interplanetary settlements without the risk of human death.</p>
	<h2> AI Art </h2>
	<p> Current AI art consists of AI finding similar images and piecing them together and then calling it an original artwork.</p>
	<h2> AI Writing</h2>
	<p> AI writing is relatively few, apart from the recent invention of ChatGPT, an AI which responds to your questions and engages in conversation. It uses machine learning to read articles and learn to respond.</p>
<h2> AI weaponry</h2>
<p> Use of robotic weaponry has increased very much recently, including the use of automated robots and rescue dogs, and other missile defence systems. </p>
