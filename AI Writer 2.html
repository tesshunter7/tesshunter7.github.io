<p> Thoughts: The AI writes almost as if a human were doing so. I wouldn't question it if I were reading this in a normal articleÔºÅHowever, there are a variety of problems with the accuracy of the writing (information). For example, "Youthful Days' Graffiti" is not Mafumafu's own song, and he hasn't even sang it before. Creating his own game development company is also not verified. The AI lacks real facts and informational writing, only being vague and rambling on. 6.5/10</p>
